I'm Matt, I'm a software developer with 10+ years of programming experience. I enjoy solving interesting problems, ones that typically exist at the intersection of my hobbies and code. These include retro videogame reverse engineering, decompilation, source code preservation, porting, emulation, programming language development, chess engines, and so on. Sometimes I write about these topics and more on [my blog](https://mattbruv.github.io/).

My current focus is on the [BFBB Decompilation Project](https://github.com/bfbbdecomp/bfbb) where we are reverse engineering the source code of [BFBB (2003)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants:_Battle_for_Bikini_Bottom) (GameCube, PowerPC) in order to eventually create a PC port which is highly anticipated by fans of the game. 

The languages I enjoy using the most are:
